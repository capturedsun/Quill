Constructor Parameters

    In swift, can choose to pass in parameters from outside or not
    This works because of labels and ability to override based on parameters

    In JS, how would I init state from within but pass in another parameter?

Refresh in Subpages

    The hosting service needs to redirect all pages to the main index.html
    This is the problem with Forum - you navigate, it's fine, refresh, goes away
